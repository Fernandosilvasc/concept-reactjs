## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, I created a application to put in practice what I have learned in ReactJS!

This will be an application to storage portfolio repositories, that will allow to list, update, and delete repositories, and besides that, the repositories can also receive likes.

The last challenge I made the backend part that you can check through this url: **[Link](https://github.com/Fernandosilvasc/gostack_challenge-concept-nodejs)**

### Application Routes

This was requested through that challenge.

- **`List your API repositories`**: You should be able to create a list with the **title** field of all repositories that are registered in your API.

- **`Add a repository to your API`**: You should be able to add a new item to your API via a button with the text **Add** and, after creation, you should be able to display its name after registration.

- **`Remove a repository from your API`**: For each item on your list, you must have a button with the text **Remove** that, when clicking, will call a function to remove that item from the list of your frontend and its API.

### Tests Specification

To complete this challenge was necessary to follow these rules:

- **`should be able to add new repository`**: For this test to pass, your application must allow a repository to be added to your backend and listed on your frontend within a `LI`.

- **`should be able to remove repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow that by clicking on the remove button that will be inside the `LI` of the added repository, the item will be removed from the list.
